Assignment 1: 30MFF Website

For this website, we had to shoot a short film with our smartphones in a group of three. I, Ramsha Bilal and Yiyang - we did parts of the video with our campus cats and did voiceovers. We also edited the video together in iMovie. 

For my website, I wanted to convey a story about 'Life in Saadiyat' and the name of the website is the same. The whole webpage is themed on 'cats' as the content is related to it. The video thumbnail doesn't reveal that it's about cats though, and that was intentional. It seems like it's gonna be a serious interview of the residents of Saadiyat Island, but it turns out that the interviews are of cats of NYUAD campus - which I believe was effectively executed.
I believe I made sure to take care of every small details in making this webpage and I contributed a lot of personal touch in it. For example, I made the logos and color saturations myself, along with thriving for a professional website vibe in here. It has a functioning menu bar, perfect elements to go with the content, and even follow me social media buttons that resemble the actual social media pages. 
I think I could almost incorporate my initial idea of the webpage that I submitted in the wireframe of the website. I struggled a lot to link the different pages to the navigation bar but it worked at the end. Also showing the posted comments on the webpage was difficult but I could do it with the help of JavaScript. The two most important interactve elements of my webpage are 1] commenting and 2] automatic slideshow. And I personalized all the fonts and colors with CSS too. In the final working version, I think most of the initial plans are implemented, except that the search bar doesn't actually show results and the comments posted are shown as a a list one after another - which didn't quite go as planned but I'm satisfied that I could implement so many different elements with my hard work and research.

My creative addition to the website:
1) I created and added a personal logo with Canva in the title bar of the webpage.
2) For the header or website name, I made a logo in Canva which represents the name and the theme of the site.
3) I adjusted all the colors of the texts and backgrounds for creating the unique aesthetic for the site.
4) I made a navigation bar or menu bar on the top and added buttons like "Home" which is the main page shown, "Newsletter" which takes you to a page where    you can subscribe to the site, "Contact Us" which takes you to the email address provided and open your email site prompt, "Leave a Review" where you      can leave comments/suggestions for the owner of the page.
5) I made a search bar alongside the menu bar where one can search for similar items.
6) I made an automatic slideshow with the photos of the campus that I had taken myself.
7) After hosting the video I had included a comment bar where the viewer can leave a comment for the site/video and it'll show up on the page.
8) I created an "About the creator" section where my personal details and the purpose of the website is included. 
9) I made four social media buttons where the user can click on and it'll take him to the specific social media site to follow.
10)I added two gifs in the last of the page to add a little bit of cuteness to the site according to the 'cat' theme :)
